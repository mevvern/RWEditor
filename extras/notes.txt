material types:

tiling : tiles with no varieties

randomised tiling : tiles with varieties

connected tiling : tiles change their sprite based on the tile that occupies neighbor spaces

connected randomised tiling : tiles change their sprite based on neighbor spaces but can also choose a randomised sprite variety if the state of neighbors allows it

ransomised sprites : doesn't follow a grid as well as the others, instead the region occupied by the tile has randomised sprites put in it

subtexture : the tiles don't have any tiling texture, instead they act as a positive mask for a texture that takes up the whole screen

prop types:

signs : a randomised sprite taken from a sign texture. set to the Effect color. gradients can allow the Effect color to fade in and out with the regular lit/half lit/shadow depth color shit.


each layer has 3 textures:

base: 
shadow: 
decal:
